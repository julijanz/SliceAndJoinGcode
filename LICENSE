                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2026 Anonymous

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            PREDAMBLE

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

...

1. Source Code.

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.

...

13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to copy and distribute the resulting work.  The
terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain
licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

...

17. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions require your acceptance of
this License.

...

            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
